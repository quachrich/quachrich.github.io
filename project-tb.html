                    Python-based analysis of 100,000+ individual data points on TB cases in correctional facilities across
                    Latin America, supporting time series visualization and policy-relevant insights for correctional health systems.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        As part of my undergraduate research role at Boston University School of Public Health, I contributed to a
                        tuberculosis surveillance project examining the growth of TB cases in prison populations across the Americas.
                        Correctional facilities represent a high-risk environment for TB transmission due to overcrowding, limited
                        ventilation, and barriers to care — making longitudinal surveillance data especially critical for policymakers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The work involved compiling, cleaning, and extracting a large dataset of incarcerated TB cases, then
                        using Python to visualize trends over time and surface patterns relevant to correctional health policy.

                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>
                        I worked as an undergraduate researcher supporting the data pipeline and analysis for the TB surveillance component
                        of the EPISTORM lab's broader public health research portfolio.

                    <ul class="project-list">
                        <li><strong>Data compilation:</strong> Gathered and consolidated 100,000+ individual data points on TB cases in prison populations, primarily across Latin America.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data cleaning:</strong> Cleaned and standardized raw records using Python to ensure consistency across sources with varying formats and reporting conventions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data extraction:</strong> Extracted structured variables from heterogeneous source materials to enable downstream analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time series visualization:</strong> Built visualizations in Python to illustrate the growth of TB cases in correctional populations over time, supporting policy-facing interpretation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Research communication:</strong> Delivered findings as part of weekly research briefs to interdisciplinary teams of 20+ members.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <strong>Note:</strong> This project was conducted within the EPISTORM research group at Boston University School of Public Health.
                        I contributed as an undergraduate research assistant supporting data work. Study design and research leadership were managed by principal investigators and senior researchers.

                    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        TB incidence in incarcerated populations is estimated to be significantly higher than in the general population
                        in many countries across Latin America. Prisons act as amplification settings — where undetected cases spread
                        rapidly and release cycles create spillover risk into surrounding communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Longitudinal data analysis is foundational to understanding whether TB burden is growing, stable, or declining
                        in these settings, and to evaluating whether public health interventions are reaching the people who need them most.

                        <li><strong>Cleaning challenges:</strong> Heterogeneous source formats, inconsistent variable naming, and missing data requiring systematic handling.</li>
                        <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Time series plots charting TB case growth across correctional populations over multi-year periods.</li>

                        This project ran alongside my support of the EPISTORM SickMix study, which focused on contact tracing
                        and behavioral surveillance for acute respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. Both projects deepened
                        my interest in data-driven approaches to infectious disease surveillance and the structural determinants of health.
