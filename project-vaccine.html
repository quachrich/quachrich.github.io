          <h2>Overview</h2>

          <p>
            PCDC’s COVID-19 resources emphasize practical barrier removal: helping residents retrieve immunization records,
            navigate vaccination logistics, and access language-appropriate information. PCDC also supported community-facing
            messaging and maintained a directory of vaccination sites with details like language accessibility and hours of operation.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to resource navigation, PCDC has offered recurring COVID-19 vaccinations at the Crane Community Center
            and published outreach materials to encourage vaccination uptake.

        <div class="content-section">
          <h2>Vaccine hesitancy approach</h2>

          <p>
            The program treated hesitancy as a trust and access problem, not just an information deficit.
            The work combined culturally tailored messaging with concrete next steps, including where to get vaccinated,
            how to find language-accessible sites, and how to replace lost vaccine cards through official record requests.
          </p>

          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Access-first design:</strong> Reduce friction by pairing clear guidance with direct links, forms, and contact points.</li>
            <li><strong>Language accessibility:</strong> Provide bilingual or multilingual materials so residents can act without intermediaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Community narrative:</strong> Use values-based messaging that connects vaccination to protecting family and community.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>My contribution</h2>

          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Resource support:</strong> Helped residents navigate COVID-19 vaccine resources and administrative steps, including record retrieval workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Outreach execution:</strong> Supported community-facing vaccine encouragement activities aligned with PCDC’s public campaign materials.</li>
            <li><strong>On-the-ground operations:</strong> Assisted across program needs during a high-throughput period for vaccine equity work.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct impact:</strong> Contributed to vaccination delivery efforts totaling 1,000+ people during my 4-month tenure (my role contribution estimate).</li>
