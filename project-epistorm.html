                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>EPISTORM (EPIdemiological STudies and Outbreak Response Modeling) is a five-year, $17.5 million CDC-funded initiative to create tools that enhance infectious disease response capabilities across the United States. As an undergraduate research assistant at Boston University School of Public Health, I supported the SickMix study—a groundbreaking investigation into how sick people and their household contacts change their behavior during acute illness.</p>
                    
                    <p>The SickMix study recruited over 1,000 participants experiencing acute respiratory infections (ARI) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) from Kaiser Permanente Northwest in Portland, OR. The study tracked how symptomatic individuals and their household members modified their social contact patterns over a two-week period, providing rare real-world evidence of behavioral changes during illness.</p>

                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>As an undergraduate research assistant on the EPISTORM team at Boston University School of Public Health, I supported the SickMix study's data infrastructure and project coordination:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="project-list">
                        <li><strong>REDCap survey support:</strong> Assisted with finalizing contact tracing surveys in REDCap and implementing data validation logic to capture detailed contact patterns across three time points (Figure 1)</li>
                        <li><strong>Data quality assurance:</strong> Supported data quality checks and cleaning workflows to ensure epidemiologically meaningful information was collected from 1,000+ participants</li>
                        <li><strong>IRB and compliance:</strong> Helped navigate IRB requirements and HIPAA compliance protocols for sensitive health data collection</li>
                        <li><strong>Team coordination:</strong> Delivered weekly research briefs to interdisciplinary teams of 20+ members, translating technical findings for audiences ranging from undergraduate peers to senior researchers</li>
                        <li><strong>Project meetings:</strong> Attended monthly project conferences to support protocol refinements and contribute to discussions on study implementation</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; padding: 1rem; background: rgba(248, 244, 241, 0.05); border-left: 3px solid var(--accent); font-size: 0.95rem;">
                        <strong>Note:</strong> The SickMix study was led by the EPISTORM research team at Boston University School of Public Health. I contributed as a research assistant supporting survey infrastructure, data management, and project coordination. The study design, participant recruitment, and data analysis were conducted by the principal investigators and research scientists.

                    <h2>Study Design</h2>
                    <p>The SickMix study employed a longitudinal design to capture behavioral changes over time:</p>
                    
                    <img src="images/sickmix-figure1.jpg" alt="SickMix data collection protocol showing three survey timepoints for cases and two for household members" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 2rem auto; display: block; border: 1px solid rgba(248, 244, 241, 0.2);">
                    
                    <p><em>Figure 1: Data collection protocol. Cases completed surveys at their sickest day, 1-week follow-up, and 2-week follow-up. Household members completed two surveys to track behavioral changes after exposure.</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Participants reported demographic information, employment details, and comprehensive contact data including number of interactions, duration, and settings. The study also captured illness-mitigation behaviors such as handwashing frequency, mask wearing, and isolation practices.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>The SickMix study revealed important patterns in how people modify their behavior during acute illness:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="project-list">
                        <li><strong>Substantial contact reduction:</strong> Symptomatic individuals reduced social contacts at peak illness and gradually increased interactions during recovery, with about 85% more daily contacts two weeks post-illness</li>
                        <li><strong>Variation by demographics:</strong> Contact patterns varied significantly across age groups, occupations, and individual characteristics</li>
                        <li><strong>Setting-specific changes:</strong> Contacts in schools, childcare, and community settings increased most sharply as people recovered (Figure 2)</li>
                        <li><strong>Household contact dynamics:</strong> While the number of home contacts remained stable, time spent with household members increased during recovery</li>
                        <li><strong>Household member behavior:</strong> Close contacts who were exposed but not visibly ill also modified their behavior, representing an understudied but critical transmission pathway</li>
                        <li><strong>High mitigation adoption:</strong> Over 80% of symptomatic individuals reported taking at least one preventive action on their sickest day</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <img src="images/sickmix-figure2.jpg" alt="Bar chart showing contact duration and average number across different settings over time" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px; margin: 2rem auto; display: block; border: 1px solid rgba(248, 244, 241, 0.2);">
                    
                    <p><em>Figure 2: Durations and average numbers of social contacts by setting. The orange line shows average number of contacts, while stacked bars show contact duration. School/daycare and "other" settings show the sharpest increases as people recovered.</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Impact on Disease Modeling</h2>
                    <p>The research team incorporated these behavioral data into mathematical transmission models, demonstrating that traditional models assuming fixed behavior patterns can lead to biased estimates of disease transmissibility and intervention effectiveness. This has important implications for public health decision-making during outbreaks.</p>
                    
                    <p>By showing how people actually behave when sick—rather than assuming perfect isolation or unchanged behavior—the SickMix study provides evidence that strengthens the realism and accuracy of epidemic forecasting models.</p>

                    <h2>Related Work</h2>
                    <p>During my time with the Boston University School of Public Health team, I also supported tuberculosis surveillance research, contributing to analysis of 100,000+ data points on TB cases in prison populations across Latin America. This work involved Python-based data cleaning, visualization, and time series analysis to support policy recommendations for correctional health systems.</p>
